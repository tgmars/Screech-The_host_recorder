# Screech, the host recorder
Record details and effects generated by tools, tactics and procedures taken against a host in a reproducible, testable manner. 

3 tiers of infrastructure.
1. Tester - configure and execute Screech from here. This host starts tracing on the victim just prior to the attacker launching its payload. 
2. Attacker - infrastructure that is built using configs specified by tester so that the appropriate dependency are met to execute a particular attack or TTP. 
3. Victim - infrastructure that is built to be attacked, and records all activity related to the attack. 

Steps of execution
1. Build Attacker and Victim hosts per spec
2. Receive a ready from Attacker and Victim hosts (Vagrant will handle this for us)
3. Test signals Victim to start tracing all execution via Procmon
4. Signal to attacker to launch its payload at Victim
5. Attacker launches payload at Victim
6. Attacker signals Tester that payload has completed executing
7. Tester signals Victim to stop tracing via Procmon and retrieves the log
